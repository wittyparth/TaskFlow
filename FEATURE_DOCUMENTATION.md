## üéØ Core Features Overview

### 1. Advanced Feature Gates
**Location**: `components/feature-flags/advanced-feature-gate.tsx`

**What it does**: 
- Implements sophisticated feature access control with multiple conditions
- Supports user properties, subscription tiers, and custom rules
- Provides fallback UI for users without access

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Uses PostHog's feature flag evaluation with complex conditions
const hasAdvancedAccess = useFeatureFlag('advanced-analytics-access')
const userTier = user?.subscription_tier || 'free'
const hasProAccess = ['pro', 'enterprise'].includes(userTier)

// Combines multiple conditions for feature access
const canAccessFeature = hasAdvancedAccess && hasProAccess
```

**Real-world Business Application**: 
Premium SaaS features can be gradually rolled out to specific user segments (e.g., enterprise customers first) while maintaining a smooth upgrade path for lower-tier users.

---

### 2. A/B Testing Framework
**Location**: `components/feature-flags/ab-testing.tsx`

**What it does**:
- Splits users into test groups automatically
- Tracks conversion metrics for different UI variants
- Provides statistical confidence indicators

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// PostHog automatically assigns users to variants
const variant = useFeatureFlag('checkout-button-test') as 'control' | 'variant_a' | 'variant_b'

// Track conversion events for analysis
posthog.capture('checkout_completed', {
  variant: variant,
  conversion_value: orderTotal
})
```

**Real-world Business Application**: 
E-commerce companies can test different checkout button colors/text to optimize conversion rates, with automatic user segmentation and statistical analysis.

---

### 3. Gradual Feature Rollouts
**Location**: `components/feature-flags/gradual-rollout.tsx`

**What it does**:
- Controls feature availability by percentage of user base
- Monitors adoption metrics and system performance
- Allows safe rollback if issues are detected

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// PostHog manages percentage-based rollouts
const newDashboard = useFeatureFlag('new-dashboard-v2')
const rolloutPercentage = 25 // 25% of users see new version

// Track feature usage and performance
useEffect(() => {
  if (newDashboard) {
    posthog.capture('new_dashboard_viewed')
  }
}, [newDashboard])
```

**Real-world Business Application**: 
Major platform updates (like a redesigned dashboard) can be safely deployed to 5% of users initially, then gradually increased to 100% based on performance metrics and user feedback.

---

### 4. Emergency Kill Switch
**Location**: `components/feature-flags/kill-switch.tsx`

**What it does**:
- Instantly disables problematic features across all users
- Provides immediate fallback to stable versions
- Enables rapid incident response

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Remote kill switch controlled from PostHog dashboard
const paymentProcessing = useFeatureFlag('payment-processing-enabled')

// Graceful degradation when feature is disabled
if (!paymentProcessing) {
  return <MaintenanceMode message="Payment processing temporarily unavailable" />
}
```

**Real-world Business Application**: 
If a payment processing system experiences issues during Black Friday, the feature can be instantly disabled globally while maintaining the rest of the application functionality.

---

### 5. Dynamic Personalization Engine
**Location**: `components/feature-flags/personalization.tsx`

**What it does**:
- Customizes UI based on user behavior and properties
- Adapts content recommendations in real-time
- Personalizes onboarding flows for different user types

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// User segmentation based on behavior and properties
const userSegment = getUserSegment(user?.role, user?.company_size, user?.usage_pattern)
const personalizedContent = useFeatureFlag(`personalized-content-${userSegment}`)

// Dynamic content rendering
const getRecommendations = () => {
  switch(userSegment) {
    case 'enterprise': return enterpriseFeatures
    case 'startup': return growthFeatures
    case 'developer': return technicalFeatures
  }
}
```

**Real-world Business Application**: 
SaaS platforms can show enterprise customers advanced compliance features while showing startups growth-focused tools, increasing conversion by 40% through relevant content.

---

### 6. Session Recording & Analytics
**Location**: `components/feature-flags/session-recording.tsx`

**What it does**:
- Records user interactions with privacy controls
- Provides heatmaps and user journey analysis
- Identifies UX friction points automatically

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Privacy-aware session recording
useEffect(() => {
  posthog.startSessionRecording({
    maskAllInputs: true,
    maskAllText: false,
    sampleRate: 0.1 // Record 10% of sessions
  })
}, [])

// Track specific user interactions
const trackInteraction = (element: string) => {
  posthog.capture('ui_interaction', {
    element,
    page: window.location.pathname,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  })
}
```

**Real-world Business Application**: 
Product teams can identify why users abandon the checkout process by watching session recordings and seeing exactly where they get confused or frustrated.

---

### 7. User Feedback Surveys
**Location**: `components/feature-flags/surveys.tsx`

**What it does**:
- Deploys contextual surveys based on user actions
- Collects NPS scores and feature feedback
- Triggers surveys at optimal moments in user journey

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Context-aware survey triggering
useEffect(() => {
  const shouldShowSurvey = useFeatureFlag('post-purchase-survey')
  
  if (shouldShowSurvey && userJustCompletedPurchase) {
    posthog.getActiveMatchingSurveys((surveys) => {
      surveys.forEach(survey => {
        posthog.renderSurvey(survey.id, '#survey-container')
      })
    })
  }
}, [userJustCompletedPurchase])
```

**Real-world Business Application**: 
E-learning platforms can survey users immediately after course completion to gather feedback about content quality and suggest improvements for future courses.

---

### 8. Advanced Analytics Dashboard
**Location**: `components/analytics/analytics-wrapper.tsx`

**What it does**:
- Provides real-time business metrics and KPIs
- Tracks conversion funnels and user cohorts
- Generates automated insights and alerts

**Implementation Details**:
```typescript
// Comprehensive analytics tracking
const analytics = useAnalytics({
  events: ['page_view', 'feature_used', 'conversion'],
  properties: ['user_segment', 'subscription_tier', 'feature_flags'],
  cohorts: ['weekly_active', 'power_users', 'churning_users']
})

// Real-time dashboard updates
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    fetchAnalytics().then(setDashboardData)
  }, 30000) // Update every 30 seconds
}, [])
```

**Real-world Business Application**: 
Marketing teams can track campaign performance in real-time, seeing which channels drive the highest-value customers and adjusting ad spend automatically.
