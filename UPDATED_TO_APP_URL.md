# âœ… UPDATED TO USE NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL

## Changes Made

I've updated all the code to use your existing `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable instead of `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.

### Files Updated:

1. **`app/signup/page.tsx`** - All 3 locations:
   - Main signup `emailRedirectTo`
   - Fallback signup `emailRedirectTo` 
   - Social signup `redirectTo`

2. **`app/verify-email/page.tsx`**:
   - Email resend `emailRedirectTo`

3. **`EMAIL_VERIFICATION_REDIRECT_FIX.md`**:
   - Updated documentation to reflect correct env var

## Your Environment Configuration âœ…

Your `.env` file already has:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

This means:
- âœ… **Development**: Email links will redirect to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
- âœ… **Production**: Email links will redirect to your deployed domain + `/dashboard`

## How It Works Now

The code now uses:
```javascript
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || window.location.origin
```

This means:
- If `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set â†’ Uses that URL
- If not set â†’ Falls back to current domain
- Since you already have it configured in deployment â†’ Perfect! ðŸŽ‰

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy your updated code** (the changes are now live in your files)
2. **Test signup flow** - should redirect properly now
3. **Check email verification links** - should point to your production domain

No environment variable changes needed - you're already set up correctly! ðŸš€
