# PostHog Dashboard Setup Checklist

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide for Each Feature

### âœ… 1. Kill Switch System Setup (30 minutes)

**PostHog Dashboard Tasks:**
- [ ] Create feature flags for each critical system:
  - `payment_system_kill_switch`
  - `ai_features_kill_switch` 
  - `social_features_kill_switch`
  - `data_export_kill_switch`
- [ ] Set all kill switches to `true` (enabled) by default
- [ ] Create custom events: `kill_switch_activated`, `kill_switch_impact`
- [ ] Build kill switch dashboard with status monitoring
- [ ] Set up Slack alerts for kill switch activations

**Code Integration:**
```typescript
// Check kill switch before critical operations
const paymentEnabled = isFeatureEnabled('payment_system_kill_switch')
if (!paymentEnabled) {
  showMaintenanceMessage()
  return
}
```

### âœ… 2. Gradual Rollout Setup (45 minutes)

**PostHog Dashboard Tasks:**
- [ ] Create percentage-based feature flags:
  - `new_checkout_flow` (start at 5%)
  - `ai_recommendations` (start at 10%)
  - `redesigned_dashboard` (start at 15%)
- [ ] Create user cohorts:
  - "Early Adopters" (admins + power users)
  - "High Value Users" (pro/enterprise subscribers)
  - "Beta Testers" (opted-in users)
- [ ] Set up rollback conditions (error rate > 5%, conversion drop > 20%)
- [ ] Create rollout tracking events: `feature_rollout_stage_change`
- [ ] Build rollout progress dashboard

**Rollout Schedule:**
```
Week 1: 5% â†’ Monitor for 48 hours
Week 2: 25% â†’ Monitor for 72 hours  
Week 3: 50% â†’ Monitor for 96 hours
Week 4: 100% â†’ Full rollout
```

### âœ… 3. A/B Testing Setup (60 minutes)

**PostHog Dashboard Tasks:**
- [ ] Create experiments in PostHog:
  - "Pricing Page Optimization" (3 variants)
  - "Onboarding Tutorial" (3 variants)
  - "Email Campaign" (2 variants)
- [ ] Define primary conversion events:
  - `subscription_started`
  - `tutorial_completed`
  - `feature_first_use`
- [ ] Set statistical significance to 95%
- [ ] Configure minimum sample size (1000+ per variant)
- [ ] Create experiment dashboard with real-time results
- [ ] Set up experiment completion alerts

**Sample Experiment:**
```
Name: "Pricing Display Test"
Traffic: 50% of visitors
Variants: 
- A (Control): Current pricing
- B: Simplified tiers

### âœ… 4. User Targeting Setup (40 minutes)

**PostHog Dashboard Tasks:**
- [ ] Define user properties in PostHog:
  - `subscription_tier` (free, pro, enterprise)
  - `user_role` (admin, member, viewer)
  - `team_size`, `industry`, `location_country`
  - `feature_usage_score`, `churn_risk_score`
- [ ] Create personalization feature flags:
  - `enterprise_features_visible`
  - `regional_compliance_features` 
  - `power_user_beta_access`
  - `new_user_onboarding_v2`
- [ ] Set up targeting conditions for each flag
- [ ] Create personalization tracking events
- [ ] Build personalization performance dashboard

**User Segmentation:**
```javascript
// High-value segment
subscription_tier = "enterprise" AND team_size > 50

// At-risk segment  
churn_risk_score > 7 AND last_active > 7 days ago

// Power user segment
feature_usage_score > 8 AND support_tickets < 3
```

### âœ… 5. Session Recording Setup (20 minutes)

**PostHog Dashboard Tasks:**
- [ ] Enable Session Replay in PostHog settings
- [ ] Configure recording settings:
  - âœ… Record all sessions (or set sample rate)
  - âœ… Mask sensitive data (passwords, emails)
  - âœ… Record console logs and network requests
- [ ] Set up session filters:
  - High-value sessions (conversions, long duration)
  - Problem sessions (errors, rage clicks)
- [ ] Create behavior tracking events:
  - `rage_click_detected`
  - `javascript_error`
  - `page_performance`
- [ ] Build session analysis dashboard
- [ ] Set up error rate alerts

**Key Sessions to Monitor:**
```
Priority 1: Sessions with conversions
Priority 2: Sessions with errors  
Priority 3: Sessions with rage clicks
Priority 4: Long sessions (>5 minutes)
Priority 5: Mobile vs desktop behavior
```

- [ ] Set up survey targeting rules:
  - NPS: Active users after 14+ days
  - Satisfaction: Users who used specific features
  - Exit: Users on cancellation flow
- [ ] Configure survey display settings (popup vs modal)
- [ ] Create survey response events and tracking
- [ ] Build survey analytics dashboard
- [ ] Set up low NPS score alerts

**Survey Schedule:**
```
