# Email Verification Diagnostics

## Current Status
- ✅ Signup works without 500 errors
- ❌ No verification email is being sent
- ❌ Auth state showing as undefined

## Likely Root Cause
**Supabase Email Confirmation is DISABLED in your project settings.**

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Check Supabase Email Settings
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication > Settings**
3. Look for **"Enable email confirmations"**
4. **Enable it** if it's currently disabled

### 2. Alternative: Disable Email Confirmation (if not needed)
If you don't want email verification:
1. In Supabase Dashboard: **Authentication > Settings**
2. **Disable "Enable email confirmations"**
3. Users will be able to sign in immediately without verification

## What's Happening Now

### In the Logs, You Should See:
```
🔐 User created but no session - email confirmation required
✉️ Confirmation sent at: null (or timestamp)
✅ Email confirmed at: null
```

- If `confirmation_sent_at` is **null**: Email confirmations are disabled in Supabase
- If `confirmation_sent_at` has a **timestamp**: Email was sent, check spam folder

### Expected Auth Flow:
1. **Email confirmations ENABLED**: User → Signup → Verification Email → Click Link → Dashboard
2. **Email confirmations DISABLED**: User → Signup → Dashboard (immediate access)

## Testing After Fix

1. **If you enable email confirmations**:
   - Signup should redirect to `/verify-email`
   - Check email for verification link
   - Click link should redirect to dashboard

2. **If you disable email confirmations**:
   - Signup should redirect directly to dashboard
   - Auth state should be properly set

## Auth State Issue
The "undefined" auth state happens because:
- User is created but not confirmed
- No session exists until email is verified
- Auth provider shows no user until session exists

This will resolve once email verification is properly configured.

## Quick Test Commands

After making changes, test with these console commands in the browser:

```javascript
// Check current session
const { data: session } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
console.log('Current session:', session)

// Check auth state changes
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
  console.log('Auth event:', event, session?.user?.email)
})
```
